✅ 1) Logic of why the code failed
(Execution order + DOM + Async)
What went wrong

Your JavaScript ran before the HTML elements were created.

So when JS tried to find the element:

document.getElementById("joke")


It returned null, because the element didn’t exist yet.

Why that happens

Because the browser reads HTML from top to bottom:

HTML loads
JS runs


If JS runs too early:

DOM not ready

Element not found

API data has nowhere to go

App fails

Important point

The API was not the reason.
The API request may have worked, but the data couldn’t be displayed because DOM was not ready.

✅ 2) Logic of how your app should work
(Step-by-step flow)
Correct flow:

Browser loads HTML

Browser creates DOM

Browser runs JavaScript

JavaScript sends API request

API sends response back (after some time)

JavaScript updates the DOM (shows joke)

✅ 3) Logic in code (Pseudo-code / Algorithm)
Pseudo-code:
START

1. Wait until HTML is fully loaded
2. Find HTML elements (joke area, button)
3. When button clicked:
     a. Send request to Joke API
     b. Wait for response
     c. Convert response to readable format
     d. Show joke text in HTML
     e. Add fade animation

END

✅ 4) Logic for API call + DOM update
(Actual working logic)
Actual steps in JS:
1. Wait for DOM to load
2. Get DOM elements:
   - joke container
   - button

3. Define function getJoke():
   a. Remove fade animation
   b. Send API request using fetch()
   c. Convert response to JSON
   d. Show joke text inside joke container
   e. Add fade animation back

4. When button clicked -> call getJoke()
5. Also call getJoke() once on page load

🎯 Final Summary (in one clean paragraph)

Your app failed because JavaScript ran before the HTML DOM was fully created. So document.getElementById() returned null and the API data could not be displayed. The correct order is: load HTML → build DOM → run JavaScript → send API request → wait for response → update DOM with the joke.
